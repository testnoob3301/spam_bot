We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
What I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Let you down
Won't run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Say goodbye
Won't tell a lie
Hurt you
Give you up
Let you down
Run around
Make you cry
Say goodbye
Tell a lie
Never gonna give you up
Let you down
Won't run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Say goodbye
Won't tell a lie
Hurt you
